# Objective

The objective of this project is to adjust the QLBS model such that it may be used as a testbed for reinforcement learning algorithms.

This project is based on my master's thesis. The notebook MC-QLBS generalizes Halperin's MC-QLBS by allowing for arbitrary function approximators that are estimated using a pure empirical risk minimization approach. The notebook DQN-QLBS presents a (non-efficient) Deep Q-Network approach to solve QLBS using simulated data and a RL agent.
